<p>In the initial phase of this project, we will utilize AWS Amplify for web hosting of static resources for our website. This platform also offers a git-based workflow, facilitating continuous deployment of the website. Subsequently, we will proceed to develop dynamic pages employing JavaScript to invoke remote RESTful APIs constructed with Amazon Lambda, a serverless computing service enabling function creation, in conjunction with Amazon API Gateway for seamless integration of applications or services via APIs.

<p>The architecture for this project states that the backend of the website which will consist of HTML, CSS, Javascript will be managed by AWS Amplify. Users will then access this website through Public URL hosted by AWS Amplify. If you have your own domain name then you can link it with the service.
